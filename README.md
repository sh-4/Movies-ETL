# Movies-ETL

### Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide a clean data set of movie data for the participants of a hackathon hosted by Amazing Prime. The hackathon will provide Amazing Prime the ability to see predictions for which low budget movies that are being released will become popular. This will allow Amazing Prime to potentially buy the streaming rights for these movies at a bargained rate.

### Summary

- Raw data from Wikipedia and Kaggle has been extracted
- Data sets have been cleaned and joined together for consistency and streamlined use by hackathon participants
- Cleaned data sets have been loaded into a SQL database for use in the hackathon
